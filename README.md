# Who is LupusE?

Nobody really knows or will ever know. This Blog is just another approach to understand why the earth is moving.  
Don't excpect any answers or usefull information here.  

## 1997 - during School

I've got a domain with email, a little webspace and a Database. I've tried some things, but had to admit I'm not the creative type. Mostly html and a little CSS.  
At some time I've builded a school project, the project 'klowand.de - Ein Ort f√ºr geistige Ejakulationen und bedeutungsschwangere Worte'. The idea was nealy the same as Twitter. At a toilet wall, everybody writes, with more or less thinking behind. The base was at first a vBuilitin, later an early s9y.

## 2007 - during Work

My provider and I disagreed in some points and I moved to [tf-network](https://www.tf-network.de) with less freedom, but good conditions. At first I've builded a Blog, based on s9y. During the years it got more and more broken, because I played a lot under the hood. From simple HTML over CSS to the SQL .. until updates aren't work anymore.  

## 2019 - beside Family

The newest switch is from s9y to Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Last Year Github was bought by Microsoft, so I assume it will be a temporary solution. But until it is static content, I'm looking forward to get a similar solution ar tf-network, soon.
