# Who is LupusE?

Nobody really knows or will ever know. This Blog is just another approach to understand why the earth is moving.  
Don't excpect any answers or usefull information here.  

## 1997
I've got a domain with email, a little webspace and a Database. I've tried some things, but had to admitt I'm not the creative type.

## 2007
My provider and I disagreed in some points and I moved to tf-network.de with less freedom, but good conditions. At first I builded a Blog, based on s9y. During the years it got more and more broken, because I tied a lot.

## 2019
The newest switch is from s9y to Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Last Year Github was soled to Microsoft, so I assume it will be a temporary solution. But until it is static content, I'm looking forward to get a similar solution ar tf-network, soon.
