# Who is LupusE?

Nobody really knows or will ever know. This Blog is just another approach to understand why the earth is moving.  
Don't excpect any answers or usefull information here.  

## 1997 - School
I've got a domain with email, a little webspace and a Database. I've tried some things, but had to admit I'm not the creative type. Mostly html and a little CSS.
At some time i've builded a school project, the 'klowand.de - Ein Ort fÃ¼r geistige Ejakulationen und bedeutungsschwangere Worte'. The idea was nealy the same as Twitter. At a toilett wall, everybody writes, with more or less thinking behind. The base was at first a vBuilitin, later an early s9y.

## 2007 - Work
My provider and I disagreed in some points and I moved to tf-network.de with less freedom, but good conditions. At first I builded a Blog, based on s9y. During the years it got more and more broken, because I played a lot under the hood. From simple HTML over CSS to the SQL.. until no update was working anymore.

## 2019 - Family
The newest switch is from s9y to Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Last Year Github was bought by Microsoft, so I assume it will be a temporary solution. But until it is static content, I'm looking forward to get a similar solution ar tf-network, soon. 



# Theme
Theme based on Beautiful Jekyll. I'm still try to reduce the .js, but I think I'll keep the awsomefont dependency.
